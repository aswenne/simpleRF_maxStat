Title: Random forests with splitting rules based on the residuals from local linear models
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2022-10-24

Maintainer: Annika Swenne
Description: This package implements the "Residual variance splitting" and the "Maximally selected residual rank statistic splitting rule" 
    that have been described in my master thesis. The package uses reference classes and only plain R and is not optimized for
    computation speed. It is based on the package simpleRF (Wright 2022). The implementation of the maximally selected rank statistic was taken from maxstatRF
    (Wright, Dankowski, and Ziegler 2017).

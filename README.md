### Description
Implements the "Residual variance splitting" and the "Maximally selected residual rank statistic" splitting rules for random forests that are based on the 
    residuals from local linear models. Furthermore, it provides the possibility to fit different models in the leaves of the random forest trees. The package uses  
    reference classes and only plain R and is not optimized for computation speed. 

Be careful, this package is not extensively tested!

### Description
This repository includes the code for my master thesis "Confounder Adjustment with Random Forests based on Local Residuals in Genetic Association Studies". 

#### R package: simpleRF_maxStat 
Implements the "Residual variance splitting" and the "Maximally selected residual rank statistic" splitting rules for random forests that are based on the residuals from local linear models. Furthermore, it provides the possibility to fit different models in the leaves of the random forest trees. The package uses reference classes and only plain R and is not optimized for computation speed. 

Be careful, this package is not extensively tested!

#### Folder: Analysis
This folder includes the R scripts that were used to analyze the simulated and real-world data in my thesis.
